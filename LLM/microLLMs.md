There are some a small models: can deploy in cellphone and excel but till preserve the efficient and highly accurate for a domain-specified like AI product

=> We can control the SLM model as much as possible by focused dataset what is tailored to the unique needs or individual enterprises.

=> to do it need skills: LLM fine-tuning and RAG to enhance model performance.

- Model compression
- Knowledge distillation
- Transfer learning

## Some open-source models

- phi-3-mini (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219): 3.8B parameters trained on 3.3T tokens
- mixtral 8x7B
- llama 3.2 1B / 3B
- tiny-llama
- tiny-dolphin
- Orca
